create a database based around the information submitted from the app ( exersize, duration, description, image, category,)
(ideally this information will come from an external api, we will be using hard coded data for the time being)
create an object with hard coded exersizes, map over the object to produce the cards on the page. When select button is clicked, information is gathered from the database.
